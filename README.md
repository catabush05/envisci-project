## 1. Environmental Problem & Framing (~150 words)
The topic we hope to investigate is how do trees respond to changes in climate. Forests make up a significant part of the United States, and communities across America have aided in reforestation efforts. 

Our research aims to determine which native species are more resilient to changes in temperature, and thus will fare better in future years as temperatures continue to fluctuate. This will then inform the reforestation efforts of conservationists, who will have the information to create more resilient forests. 


## 2. Dataset Exploration (Three Options)

  [**a) Bayesian Analysis of Tree Distributions Across Space and Time in Eastern North America 2010-2011**](https://search.dataone.org/view/https%3A%2F%2Fpasta.lternet.edu%2Fpackage%2Fmetadata%2Feml%2Fknb-lter-hfr%2F182%2F13) <br>
    The dataset covers tree distribution across plots in Eastern North America, alongside environmental data points. The data was collected by Sydne Record and Aaron Ellison of Harvard Forest. The data set was published via Environmental Data Initiative. <br>
  Key variables:
  - longitude of plot (interval)
  - latitude of plot (interval)
  - presence of fagus grandifolia (logical)
  - presence of hemlock (logical)
  - annual mean temp (continuous)
  - annual mean precipitation (continuous)
  - mean diurnal range (continuous)

  [**b) A gridded database of the modern distributions of climate, woody plant taxa, and ecoregions for the continental United States and Canada**](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/620da87bd34e6c7e83ba9ba7) <br>
    The dataset covers population data for a host of woody plant species in USA and Canada. The data is broken up into a 25km grid that also contains granular environmental data points. The data was published by the US Geological Survey. <br>
  Key variables:
  - longitude of plot (interval)
  - latitude of plot (interval)
  - elevation (continuous)
  - monthly mean temperatures (continuous)
  - monthly mean precipitation (continuous)
  - presence of individual species (logical)
  - ecoregion type (nominal)
